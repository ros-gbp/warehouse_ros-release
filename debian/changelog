    only export MongoDB dependency for shared mongodb-library
  * only export MongoDB dependency for shared mongodb-library
    libmongoclient.a uses quite a number of other libs and the exact
    requirements can't be read from a cmake/pc file.
    Therefore it makes more sense to keep the dependency hidden from ROS
    when we use the static lib. libwarehouse_ros then provides all required functions.
    ... This is a bit like creating a libmongoclient.so, but the whole problem
    exists because debian/ubuntu don't provide this one, right?
    The shared library can - and has to - be exported as a dependency to ROS.
  * Missing part of https://github.com/corot/world_canvas/issues/10:
    requires both mongodb and mongodb-dev
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/corot/warehouse_ros.git
